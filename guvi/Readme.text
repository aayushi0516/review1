# **Paws & Hearts Pet Adoption - Project Documentation**

## **Project Overview**
"Paws & Hearts" is an innovative online pet adoption platform designed to help potential pet owners find the perfect companion for their homes. The platform leverages modern web technologies like Java, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, MySQL, and MongoDB to provide a seamless experience for users looking to adopt pets, make adoption requests, and contribute through donations or fostering. The goal is to simplify the pet adoption process while promoting responsible pet ownership.

### **Project Aim**
The primary aim of this project is to:
- Connect people looking to adopt pets with available animals in need of homes.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for browsing available pets based on filters (e.g., type, age, size).
- Allow users to submit adoption requests and interact with the shelter system.
- Enable easy fostering and donation options to support animals in need.
- Implement a robust back-end with MySQL and MongoDB for managing pet information, adoption requests, and user data.

## **Database Schema Overview**
This project uses two databases:
1. **MySQL Database:** Stores structured data like users, pets, and adoption requests.
   - Tables: `users`, `pets`, `adoption_requests`
2. **MongoDB (optional):** Stores unstructured or semi-structured data such as pet images, user reviews, and logs.
   - Collections: `pet_images`, `user_reviews`

The **`DBConnection.java`** class handles the connection to both databases (MySQL for relational data and MongoDB for non-relational data).

### **SQL Database Schema Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE pets (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    type VARCHAR(255),
    breed VARCHAR(255),
    age INT,
    size VARCHAR(50),
    description TEXT,
    image_url VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255),
    phone_number VARCHAR(15),
    address TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE adoption_requests (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    pet_id INT,
    user_id INT,
    request_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (pet_id) REFERENCES pets(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

## **Running the Project**

### **1. Setting Up the Development Environment**
- **Java:** Ensure that you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- **MySQL:** Set up MySQL and create the necessary database (`pet_adoption`).
- **MongoDB (optional):** Set up MongoDB if using it for image storage or user reviews.
- **IDE (Optional):** Use an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code for coding and debugging.

### **2. Setting Up the Database**
- Run the SQL queries in MySQL to set up the tables for users, pets, and adoption requests.
- (If using MongoDB) Set up the MongoDB collections for storing images and reviews.

### **3. Running the Application**
1. **Run the Java back-end:** 
   - If you're using a framework like Spring Boot, simply run the application with the following command:
     ```bash
     mvn spring-boot:run
     ```
2. **Open the Front-End in a Browser:** 
   - Launch the HTML files in a browser or host them using a local server like Apache or a back-end framework.
3. **Interact with the System:** 
   - Browse through available pets, submit adoption requests, donate, or become a foster.
